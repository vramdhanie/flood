## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start**: The grid begins with random colors, and you control the top-left cell
2. **Select Color**: Click any color button to flood your territory with that color
3. **Expand**: All adjacent cells of the selected color join your territory
4. **Strategy**: Choose colors that will capture the most adjacent cells
5. **Win**: Flood the entire 30×30 grid in the fewest steps possible!

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Strategic Gameplay**: Plan your moves to minimize steps
- 📊 **Real-time Stats**: Track steps, progress percentage, and cells owned
- 🏆 **Win Detection**: Automatic celebration when you flood the entire grid
- 🔄 **Instant Restart**: Play again without page refresh
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient flood-fill algorithm

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript strict mode

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vramdhanie/flood.git
cd flood

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm start

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎯 Game Rules

- **Grid Size**: 30×30 cells (900 total)
- **Colors**: 6 different colors to choose from
- **Starting Position**: Top-left cell is your initial territory
- **Flood Mechanism**: Selecting a color floods all connected cells of that color
- **Victory Condition**: Own all 900 cells
- **Scoring**: Minimize the number of steps to achieve the best score

## 🧠 Algorithm

The game uses an efficient **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** flood-fill algorithm:

1. **Color Change**: All owned cells change to the selected color
2. **BFS Expansion**: Starting from owned cells, expand to adjacent cells of the same color
3. **Territory Growth**: Newly captured cells become part of your territory
4. **Win Detection**: Check if all cells are owned after each move
